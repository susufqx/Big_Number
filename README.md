# Big_Number
##Background
As we all know that is we use int to define a number its extent is limit and if we want to do the calculate of serval big numbers (we cand name theses numbers big number) we have to write and define another type of data. If we learn and do the work of security of information and net, we need this kind of number. Because the key of encryption is too big and the bits is too long like 1024 or 2048 or more large. We can use the type of data by the framwork or library to define this special kind of number in Java, python etc but in C/C++, we don't have it. Maybe somebody has written the libraries of C++ which include this kind of type of data, but to learn to understand and study this language C++, we can do it ourselves.
